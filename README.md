# Art of Analytics

## Overview

Welcome to the "Art of Analytics" GitHub repository! This repository contains the files and resources related to a data science project conducted under the Society of Civil Engineers during the summer. The project aimed to explore and apply analytics techniques to enhance insights and decision-making processes in the field of civil engineering.

## Project Description

In the "Art of Analytics" project, we delved into the realm of data science to extract meaningful patterns, trends, and information from diverse datasets. The project spanned various aspects of analytics, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualization.

## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration:** Conduct a comprehensive exploration of datasets related to civil engineering to identify patterns and outliers.

2. **Analysis Techniques:** Apply various data science and analytics techniques to derive actionable insights from the data.

3. **Visualization:** Create informative and visually appealing charts, graphs, and dashboards to communicate findings effectively.

4. **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate the potential impact of analytics-driven insights on decision-making processes.
