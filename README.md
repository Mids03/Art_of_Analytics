Data Science Summer Project under the Society of Civil Engineers(SOCE)

This repository contains the assignments submitted during the project, which taught us to extract, analyze and modify data through Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas

We also learned to plot the data using Matplotlib

The project also taught us to constitute a simple Machine Learning Model to predict further values from the existing set of data. We used Sci-Kit Learn to perform the tasks required for training the Machine Learning Model.
